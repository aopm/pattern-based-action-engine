# Pattern-based Action Engine: Generating Process Management Actions Using Temporal Patterns of Process-Centric Problems

Welcome to the repository for our study titled "Pattern-based Action Engine: Generating Process Management Actions Using Temporal Patterns of Process-Centric Problems".

Our research focuses on generating process management actions based on temporal patterns of process-centric problems. This repository provides all the necessary resources, including source code and datasets, to reproduce the experimental results presented in our paper. We'll update this space with the link to our paper as soon as it becomes available.

### Getting Started
Start by cloning the repository on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/aopm/pattern-based-action-engine.git```

### Requirements
Ensure that your system has Python 3.9 or above installed. You can check your Python version by running:
```python --version```

### Installing Dependencies
Once you have the right Python version, navigate to the root directory of this project and install the necessary dependencies using:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Experiments
The experiments directory contains scripts for two experiments:

#### Experiment 1
To run Experiment 1, use the following command:
```python experiment_1.py```
This will generate a data file exp-1.csv under the ./data directory.

To create a graphical chart based on this data, use:
```python viz_exp_1.py```
This will generate a chart and save it under the ./chart directory.

#### Experiment 2
To run Experiment 2, use the following command:
```python experiment_2.py```

This will generate a chart and save it under the ./chart directory.

### Closure
Please feel free to raise any issues or questions, and we'll be glad to assist you.
